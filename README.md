## Project Introduction

### QuestChain

QuestChain is a blockchain project based on the Dash algorithm, specifically utilizing the YesPower hashing algorithm. It aims to create a decentralized digital currency system with high efficiency and rich features, tailored for in-game payments and transactions. Our goal is to provide a secure, reliable platform for users to experience fast and convenient payments within gaming ecosystems.

### Key Features

- **Algorithm**: QuestChain utilizes the Dash algorithm, incorporating the YesPower hashing algorithm for consensus and security.
- **Halving Time**: Block rewards will halve every 40,000 blocks to ensure a gradual reduction in the inflation rate.
- **Total Supply**: The total supply of the project is 2.1 billion, which will ensure there are enough tokens to support the operation and development of the system.
- **Block Rewards**: Each block is rewarded with 2000 tokens, with a portion allocated to masternodes.
- **Gaming Integration**: QuestChain is designed to seamlessly integrate with gaming platforms, providing a reliable payment solution for in-game purchases and transactions.
